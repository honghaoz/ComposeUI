  /// and the size of the node is fixed to the size of the provided view (`bounds.size`).
  /// You need to make sure the view's size is updated.
  ///
  /// If the view is constraint-based layout, don't set the node to flexible sizing by using `.flexible()` and
  /// change the node size by using `.frame(width:height:)`, this will cause "Unable to simultaneously satisfy constraints."

  ///
  /// The view's `translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints` will be set to `true` since ComposeUI uses frame-based layout.
  /// This may cause some issues if the view is constraint-based layout. For example, if the view have constraints define
  /// its size, the view's final size may not be the size of the constraints. To ensure the view's size is the size of
  /// the constraints, do a layout pass for the view so that the view's size is updated based on the constraints. For example:
  ///
  /// ```swift
  /// view.translatesAutoresizingMaskIntoConstraints = false
  /// view.setNeedsLayout()
  /// view.layoutIfNeeded() // this will update the view's size based on the constraints
  /// ```
  ///
  /// Or use `systemLayoutSizeFitting(_:)` to get the size of the view and set its `bounds.size`.
  ///
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - view: The external view.
  ///   - willInsert: A closure to be called when the view is about to be inserted into the view hierarchy.
  ///   - didInsert: A closure to be called when the view is inserted into the view hierarchy.

  ///   - willRemove: A closure to be called when the view is about to be removed from the view hierarchy.
